# api routes
* next js is a full stack framework
* we can write fe code in react and also write apis that can be used by fe code
* api routes allows us to create restful endpoints as part of our next.js application folder structure
* within the pages folder we need to create a folder called "api"
* within that "api" folder you can define all the APIs for your application
* we can add business logic without needing to write any additional custom server code and without having to configure any API routes
* nextjs gives us everything we need to write full stack react + node application
